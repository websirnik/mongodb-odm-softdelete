# Doctrine MongoDB ODM SoftDelete Functionality

This library gives you some additional classes and API for managing the soft deleted state of Doctrine
MongoDB ODM documents. To get started you just need to configure a few objects and get a SoftDeleteManager
instance:

## Setup

    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\SoftDelete\Configuration;
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\SoftDelete\UnitOfWork;
    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\SoftDelete\SoftDeleteManager;
    use Doctrine\Common\EventManager;

    // $dm is a DocumentManager instance we should already have

    $config = new Configuration();
    $evm = new EventManager();
    $sdm = new SoftDeleteManager($dm, $config, $evm);

## SoftDelete Documents

In order for your documents to work with the SoftDelete functionality they must implement the
SoftDeleteable interface:

    interface SoftDeleteable
    {
        function getDeleted();
    }

An implementation might look like this:

    use Doctrine\ODM\MongoDB\SoftDelete\SoftDeleteable;

    /** @mongodb:Document */
    class User implements SoftDeleteable
    {
        // ...

        /** @mongodb:Date */
        private $deleted;

        public function getDeleted()
        {
            return $this->deleted;
        }

        // ...
    }

## Managing Soft Delete State

Once you have the $sdm you can start managing the soft delete state of your documents:

    $jwage = $dm->getRepository('User')->findOneByUsername('jwage');
    $fabpot = $dm->getRepository('User')->findOneByUsername('fabpot');
    $sdm->delete($jwage);
    $sdm->delete($fabpot);
    $sdm->flush();

The above would issue a simple query setting the deleted date:

    db.users.update({ _id : { $in : userIds }}, { $set : { deleted : new Date() } })

Now if we were to restore the documents:

    $sdm->restore($jwage);
    $sdm->flush();

It would unset the deleted date:

    db.users.update({ _id : { $in : userIds }}, { $unset : { deleted : true } })

## Events

We trigger some additional event lifecycle events when documents are soft deleted or restored:

* Events::preSoftDelete
* Events::postSoftDelete
* Events::preRestore
* Events::postRestore

Using the events is easy, just define a class like the following:

    class TestEventSubscriber implements \Doctrine\Common\EventSubscriber
    {
        public function preSoftDelete(LifecycleEventArgs $args)
        {
            $document = $args->getDocument();
            $sdm = $args->getSoftDeleteManager();
        }

        public function getSubscribedEvents()
        {
            return array(Events::preSoftDelete);
        }
    }

Now we just need to add the event subscriber to the EventManager:

    $eventSubscriber = new TestEventSubscriber();
    $evm->addEventSubscriber($eventSubscriber);

When we soft delete something the preSoftDelete() method will be invoked before any queries are sent
to the database:

    $sdm->delete($fabpot);
    $sdm->flush();

## Cascading Soft Deletes

You can easily implement cascading soft deletes by using events in a certain way. Imagine you have a
User and Post document and you want to soft delete a users posts when you delete him.

You just need to setup an event listener like the following:

    use Doctrine\Common\EventSubscriber;

    class CascadingSoftDeleteListener implements EventSubscriber
    {
        public function preSoftDelete(LifecycleEventArgs $args)
        {
            $sdm = $args->getSoftDeleteManager();
            $document = $args->getDocument();
            if ($document instanceof User) {
                $sdm->deleteBy('Post', array('user.id' => $document->getId()));
            }
        }

        public function preRestore(LifecycleEventArgs $args)
        {
            $sdm = $args->getSoftDeleteManager();
            $document = $args->getDocument();
            if ($document instanceof User) {
                $sdm->restoreBy('Post', array('user.id' => $document->getId()));
            }
        }

        public function getSubscribedEvents()
        {
            return array(
                Events::preSoftDelete,
                Events::preRestore
            );
        }
    }

Now when you delete an instance of User it will also delete any Post documents where they reference
the User being deleted. If you restore the User, his Post documents will also be restored.
